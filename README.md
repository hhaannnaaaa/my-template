# My Very First Website

Welcome to my very first website!

This website was built as part of the learning material for Code Institute's Fullstack Web Developer program.

Check out the website [here](https://hhaannnaaaa.github.io/my-template/)!

# Project Description

This site was created to get familiar with common development tools like Cloud9, Git & GitHub, and how to use them to write and manage code. As part of the structure of the program, there will be a section that displays a breakdown of the different technologies used in each section of the program.

# Technology

This project was written in HTML & CSS using Cloud9 and is currently hosted on GitHub pages.
